# HW-Wireframe

There are two pairs of html and css files in this assignment folder, as described below:

index.html, style.css:

I have to confess that tried building the wireframe files before scrolling down to see the "Additional Specifications" section of the assignment instructions. So I originally built it setting body width=100% and using percent values to enable the layout to scale itself horizontally as the window is being resized.

Then I had to backtrack after reading the ALL the instructions. :)

Beyond learning more about setting up a wireframe, the real lesson I think I learned is to keep scrolling when reading through an assignment page!
